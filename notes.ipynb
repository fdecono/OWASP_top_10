One of these attacks can end up in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unauthorized Access:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to restricted data or functionality.\n",
    "* **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personally identifiable information.\n",
    "* **Data Manipulation:** SQL Injection allows attackers to modify, delete, or insert data into the database, altering the application’s behavior or compromising data integrity.\n",

    "There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine what level of security design is required. Common examples of insecure design in web applications include:\n",

    "* Insufficient input validation\n",
    "* Insecure data storage\n",
    "* Weak authentication and session management\n",
    "* Insecure communication\n",

    "### Threat Modeling to counter Insecure Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "A proactive approach to identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities. It typically involves following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify assets:** Determine what sensitive data or critical functionality your application needs to protect.\n",
    "2. **Create a system model:** Document your application’s architecture, components, and data flows.\n",
    "3. **Identify potential threats:** Analyze the system model to identify possible attack vectors and vulnerabilities.\n",
    "4. **Determine risk:** Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified threat.\n",
    "5. **Develop mitigations:** Design and implement security measures to address the highest-priority threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 Question Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What are we building?** Understand the system, its context, components and their interaction, data flow, security controls, and dependencies.\n",
    "2. **What can go wrong?** Identify threats and possible vulnerabilities. You could use techniques like STRIDE, attack trees or kill chains.\n",
    "3. **What are we going to do about that?** Determine and implement security measures to protect the system against identified threats.\n",
    "4. **Did we do a good enough job?** Validate the security measures and iterate the process. Verification can be done via methods like code review, penetration testing, and red teaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaches to Threat Modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Asset-centric:** This approach starts by identifying and classifying a system’s assets and then focuses on the threats to those assets.\n",
    "2. **System-centric (or architecture-centric):** This approach focuses on the system’s design and components and their interactions. It identifies threats based on the attack surface exposed by the system’s architecture.\n",
    "3. **Attacker-centric:** This approach starts by assuming the perspective of the attacker, their skills, motives, and objectives, and then identifies threats based on what parts of the system the attacker would likely target.\n",
    "4. **List-centric:** Approaches to threat modeling, using tools such as the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), provide a systematic and comprehensive checklist for evaluating the security of software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List-Centric Approaches to Threat Modeling with ASVS:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASVS is a framework of sec requirements and controls that developers and sec testers can use to build and evaluate the security of web applications.

    "\n",
    "*BENEFITS:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplicity and Accessibility:** A checklist-based approach simplifies threat modeling by providing a set of predefined security requirements that must be addressed. This can be especially helpful for teams that don’t have a dedicated security expert.\n",
    "* **Coverage:** Checklists like ASVS provide broad coverage of potential security threats, ensuring that important issues aren’t overlooked. They cover various types of vulnerabilities, so you’re less likely to miss an important aspect.\n",
    "* **Standardization and Consistency:** Using a standardized checklist can promote consistency in security testing, making it easier to compare and benchmark the security of different applications.\n",
    "* **Ease of Use:** Checklists can be easy to use, providing a straightforward way for teams to verify that they’ve addressed all relevant security issues.\n",
    "* **Documentation and Traceability:** Checklists also provide a way to document the security requirements and controls that have been implemented, which can be useful for auditing, regulatory compliance, and other purposes.\n",

    "## Security Misconfiguration:\n",
    "\n",
    "The application might be vulnerable if the application is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud services.\n",
    "2. Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).\n",
    "3. Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.\n",
    "4. Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.\n",
    "5. For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.\n",
    "6. The security settings in the application servers, application frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases, etc., are not set to secure values.\n",
    "7. The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are not set to secure values.\n",
    "8. The software is out of date or vulnerable (see A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Default Configuration Settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the initial settings that are set by the developer when the software is installed or deployed. They are designed to provide a functional baseline for the application. However, if these settings are not properly configured, they can become a security risk. The use of default config settigns can lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictable Credentials:** Default settings often include default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily guessed by attackers.\n",
    "* **Unnecessary Features:** Some default configurations enable features or services that may not be needed for a specific application, potentially exposing additional attack surfaces.\n",
    "* **Lack of Security Hardening:** Default settings may not be optimized for security, resulting in weaker encryption algorithms, insecure protocols, or outdated software versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* MongoDB: In older versions of MongoDB, the default configuration did not enable authentication by default. This means anyone with network access to the database could potentially access and manipulate the data without providing any form of authentication. This lack of authentication posed a serious security risk, as it allowed unauthorized individuals to gain unrestricted access to sensitive information. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to view, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to data breaches and compromised systems. It also allowed for the possibility of unauthorized privilege escalation, where attackers could gain administrative access and take control of the entire database.\n",
    "* Elasticsearch: Similarly, older versions of Elasticsearch also had a default configuration that did not enable authentication by default. This meant that anyone who had network access to the Elasticsearch cluster could perform various actions, including reading, modifying, or deleting data, without providing any credentials. Without authentication, Elasticsearch clusters were exposed to potential unauthorized access and manipulation, posing a significant security risk. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to tamper with data, perform unauthorized searches, or even delete critical indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "These misconfigurations were often exploited by attackers leveraging services like Shodan. Shodan is a popular search engine for Internet-connected devices that allows users to discover publicly accessible systems and services. Attackers would utilize Shodan to identify exposed instances of MongoDB or Elasticsearch with default or insecure configurations. They could then target these vulnerable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Insecure Settings in Web Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "These settings typically involve poor configuration, insufficient security controls, or a lack of awareness in securing sensitive data. Some examples of insecure settings in web applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Default or weak credentials for administrative interfaces\n",
    "* Insecure storage of sensitive data (e.g., plaintext passwords or API keys)\n",
    "* Misconfigured security headers and cookies\n",
    "* Outdated or vulnerable software and libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Leading to security issues, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensitive Data Exposure:** When sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, personal information, or financial data) is inadequately protected, it becomes an easy target for attackers.\n",
    "* **Unauthorized Access:** Insecure settings can allow attackers to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, granting them unauthorized access to the system.\n",
    "* **Session Hijacking:** Improper session management can enable attackers to hijack user sessions, leading to unauthorized access and potential data theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Outdated Software and Libraries: Security Problems in Web Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the constantly evolving world of technology, keeping up with the latest updates and security patches is essential to maintain a secure and reliable web application. Outdated software and libraries can expose web applications to a variety of security risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security vulnerabilities:** Outdated software and libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. By not updating your components, you leave your web application open to a wide range of attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and remote code execution.\n",
    "* **Incompatibility issues:** As technology progresses, older versions of software and libraries may become incompatible with newer systems and standards. This can lead to performance issues, bugs, and even security vulnerabilities that are difficult to identify and fix.\n",
    "* **Limited support:** Software and library developers typically focus their efforts on maintaining and improving the latest versions of their products. This means that older versions may receive less attention and support, making it harder to find and fix security issues.\n",
    "* **Legal and compliance risks:** Outdated software and libraries may not meet the latest industry regulations and compliance standards, which can lead to legal and financial penalties for businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these risks and maintain a secure web application, it is crucial to keep your software and libraries up-to-date. This includes regularly updating your operating system, web server, database management system, and any third-party libraries your application relies on. Additionally, it is important to monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases to stay informed about potential threats and apply patches as needed. Stay vigilant!\n",

    "\n",
    "Identification and authentication are fundamental elements of any security paradigm:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identification** is asserting an identity—typically through a username or ID number in web applications.\n",
    "* **Authentication** is verifying that identity—usually through a password, but it can also involve other methods like tokens, biometrics, and digital certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.\n",
    "* Permits brute force or other automated attacks.\n",
    "* Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as “Password1” or “admin/admin”.\n",
    "* Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes, such as “knowledge-based answers,” which cannot be made safe.\n",
    "* Uses plain text, encrypted or weakly hashed password data stores (see A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures).\n",
    "* Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication.\n",
    "* Exposes session identifier in the URL.\n",
    "* Reuse session identifier after successful login.\n",
    "* Does not correctly invalidate Session IDs. User sessions or authentication tokens (mainly single sign-on (SSO) tokens) aren’t properly invalidated during logout or a period of inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute Forcing:\n",
    "\n",
    "A brute force attack is one of the simplest, yet most effective methods to gain unauthorized access to a system. It involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of brute force attacks is also their weakness. As the length and complexity of the password or encryption key increase, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially, making brute-force attacks more time-consuming and less feasible. That’s why security experts always stress the importance of strong, complex passwords and encryption keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern systems have security measures in place to defend against brute-force attacks. These measures include account lockouts after a certain number of failed attempts, delays between attempts to slow down the process, and even notifications to users about multiple failed login attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro to Dictionary Attacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack that uses a list of known passwords or patterns to try to guess the correct password. This method is often used when an attacker has a list (or a dictionary) of valid usernames and passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro to Sensitive Data in Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "In both client-side and server-side code, comments are often used by developers to explain complex coding structures, note areas for future improvement, or even provide debugging details. While this can improve collaboration and understanding amongst a development team, it can also provide an unintended goldmine of information for malicious actors. For instance, comments may point out vulnerabilities, reveal important details about the system architecture, or even contain hard-coded credentials intended for testing. Such exposure can give attackers a deeper understanding of the application’s workings and potential weak points.\n",

    "Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that do not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). Attackers could potentially upload their updates to be distributed and run on all installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example attack scenarios:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update without signing: Many home routers, set-top boxes, device firmware, and others do not verify updates via signed firmware.\n",
    "2. Insecure Deserialization:A React application calls a set of Spring Boot microservices. Being functional programmers, they tried to ensure that their code is immutable. The solution they came up with is serializing the user state and passing it back and forth with each request. An attacker notices the “rO0” Java object signature (in base64) and uses the Java Serial Killer tool to gain remote code execution on the application server.\n",

    "### Intro to Insecure Object Deserialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "A vulnerability that occurs when an application doesn’t properly validate or sanitize input before attempting to “deserialize” it. Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized object (e.g., a string of bytes) back into an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it can be a security risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can modify the serialized data to include malicious code, and the application doesn’t validate or sanitize this data before deserializing it, then the attacker’s code can be executed.\n",
    "* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious serialized data can also cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n",
    "* **Injection Attacks:** Insecure deserialization can lead to various injection attacks, including but not limited to SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, OS command injection, etc.\n",

    "### Intro to Rogue Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Untrusted Data Sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CDNs are a key part of modern web infrastructure, designed to efficiently deliver web content to users. A CDN’s main function is to serve content to users with high availability and high performance. Rogue CDNs can serve harmful content, either by hosting malicious files directly or by serving as a conduit for malware, thus putting users at risk.\n",
    "* Loading data from untrusted sources, such as JavaScript (JS) files, is a common practice in web development. If the external source is compromised, the attacker can serve malicious JS files instead of legitimate ones. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, and defacement of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Potential Security Problems:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Integrity:** Rogue CDNs or compromised data sources can alter the data being sent to users. This could include injecting malicious scripts into legitimate web pages or altering the functionality of web applications.\n",
    "2. **Privacy:** Malicious CDNs or data sources could collect sensitive user information without consent. For example, they could track user behavior, collect form data, or even steal login credentials.\n",
    "3. **Availability:** A rogue CDN could deny service to intended users or serve them slow or inaccurate content. This can be particularly damaging for businesses that rely heavily on their online presence.\n",

    "## Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs at any time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, are not logged.\n",
    "* Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages.\n",
    "* Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.\n",
    "* Logs are only stored locally.\n",
    "* Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective.\n",
    "* Penetration testing and scans by dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools (such as OWASP ZAP) do not trigger alerts.\n",
    "* The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Security Logging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Logging is the process of recording and storing actions and events within a system. This can include user activities, system errors, transactions, and more. Logs provide a traceable record of these activities and can be analyzed to uncover patterns or identify suspicious behavior.\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Example log entry:\n",
    "[2023-06-09 10:15:32] - IP: 192.0.2.1 - User: exampleUser - Action: Login - Status: Success\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Security Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs not only provide insights into system operations, but they also serve as an audit trail for security events. However, often, organizations overlook or inadequately address security logging. When critical logs are missing, unclear, or not actively monitored, the organization's security posture weakens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Auditable Events:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Auditable events, such as user logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, form the crux of security logging. By not logging these events, organizations are essentially turning a blind eye to potentially malicious activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logins and Failed Logins: Tracking successful and unsuccessful login attempts can indicate brute force or password spraying attacks. Absence of this data means you might miss out on early signs of a breach.\n",
    "* High-Value Transactions: These can be database modifications, money transfers, or any other critical operations. Without a log, malicious or erroneous transactions can go unnoticed, potentially leading to significant losses or damages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inadequate Logging of Warnings and Errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When these log messages are absent, unclear, or insufficient, it becomes challenging to identify the root cause, making mitigation more difficult and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ignoring App and API Logs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not monitoring their logs for suspicious activity can lead to undetected breaches. An unusual API call or an unexpected application behavior logged can be the first sign of an intrusion. Ignoring these logs can mean missed opportunities for early detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Perils of Local Storage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing logs solely on local servers or devices poses various risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Tampering: If an attacker gains access, they can modify or delete logs to hide their tracks.\n",
    "* Data Loss: Hardware failures can lead to permanent loss of crucial log data.\n",
    "* Limited Access: It is challenging to access logs in real-time for analysis or during an incident if they are only locally stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized or cloud-based log storage solutions address these challenges, offering redundancy, accessibility, and often enhanced security features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ineffective Alerting and Response Systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs alone are passive data. For them to be effective in enhancing security, there must be systems in place to analyze and act upon them. If appropriate alerting thresholds are not set, or if there is no effective escalation process in place, even the most detailed logs can go unnoticed, rendering them useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unresponsive to Penetration Testing and DAST Tools:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Security tools like OWASP ZAP are designed to probe applications for vulnerabilities actively. If these tools do not trigger alerts when they simulate attacks, it indicates a considerable gap in the organization's detection capabilities. It is almost like having a smoke detector that does not sound when there is smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of Real-time Attack Detection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cyber-attacks can be swift and devastating. If an application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time, the damages can be extensive before any action is taken. This makes real-time monitoring and alerting not just a good-to-have feature but an essential one.\n",

Through practical examples, we discovered how a ‘security by design’ approach can mitigate such risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Misconfiguration**\n",
    "Here we examined the potential dangers of security misconfiguration, which is often the result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, or unprotected cloud storage. Our lab exercises demonstrated how to detect these vulnerabilities and the necessity of a well-defined, repeatable hardening process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vulnerable and Outdated Components**\n",
    "This part of the course focused on the risks posed by the use of vulnerable and outdated software components. We practiced identifying, updating, and removing such components to minimize the attack surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification and Authentication Failures**\n",
    "We learned about the threats arising from flawed identification and authentication strategies, which can allow attackers to impersonate users or bypass authentication. We explored techniques for implementing multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, and secure session management to help combat these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software and Data Integrity Failures**\n",
    "In this module, we addressed the importance of maintaining the integrity of software and data. You experienced how a lack of proper integrity controls can lead to unauthorized data modification or code execution. We also examined defenses such as checksums, digital signatures, and secure file permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**\n",
    "Here we discussed the lack of adequate logging and monitoring, which could delay or prevent the detection of security breaches. We observed the value of comprehensive and proactive monitoring practices and learned how to implement effective logging mechanisms that capture important security-related events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**\n",
    "The course concluded with an exploration of SSRF, where malicious actors can induce the server to perform requests on their behalf. We discussed various techniques for mitigating this risk, such as validating and sanitizing all input data, employing allow-lists of approved servers, and applying the least privilege principle.\n"
